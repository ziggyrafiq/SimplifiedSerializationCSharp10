# A simplified approach to serializing and deserializing objects in C# 10
This repository provides a simplified approach to serializing and deserializing objects in C# 10. The process of serialization involves converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, whereas deserialization involves reconstructing the object from its serialized form in reverse. This repository demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize tasks efficiently and straightforwardly using C# 10.
